usage: lnr <linktoDir> <dirname> -- <lnr-options>

  Links all directories with name <dirname>, found recursively from the current dir, to the <linktoDir>.
  If dirname is not supplied it defaults to the name of the directory being linked to.

OPTIONS:

  -l, --loglevel  level at which to log: silly|verbose|info|warn|error|silent -- default: info

  -f, --filter    additional filters to apply to than just matching <dirname>
                  currently existing filters are:
                    - isPackage: matches if the directory contains an npm package, i.e. the parent
                      directory is node_modules
  
  -h, --help      Print this help message.


EXAMPLES:
  
  Link all directories with name mydir to the directory of the same name that is a sibling of my current working dir
    
    lnr ../mydir mydir

  Same as above, but omitting the dirname since it is the same as the name of the directory being linked to
    
    lnr ../mydir mydir

  Link all directories with name mydir to the directory of the same name that is a sibling of my current working dir and
  an npm package and log verbose.
    
    lnr ../mydir mydir --filter isPackage -l verbose
